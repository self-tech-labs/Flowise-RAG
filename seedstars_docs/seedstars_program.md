# Our intended impact - To contribute to positive economic and social impact in emerging economies we use a Theory of Change to drive our initiatives

About Seedstars

Methodology & Differentiation
Market & Positioning
Track Record
Team

Seedstars is powered by a Theory of Change that delineates our impact, driven by the efforts of our teams, ventures and partners and their collaborations with enterprises in emerging markets. Seedstars is built on the principle that nurturing entrepreneurship triggers economic growth in emerging markets, and when combined with supporting entrepreneurs with purpose-driven missions even greater impact can be achieved.

Our approach is to build and nurture a network of partners, mentors, financing partners investors and entrepreneurs. From this network, there is a wealth of opportunities to support high-growth enterprises. Leveraging this network we cultivate a vibrant ecosystem that offers a holistic spectrum of support to promising entrepreneurs. This includes imparting crucial skills, providing invaluable business development and advisory services, and facilitating access to capital. With these resources, entrepreneurs are empowered to build and scale their ventures sustainably.

As a result, enterprises not only increase the average monthly revenue and impact, which increases their opportunity to attract follow-on investment for further growth, but they are also able to significantly contribute to job creation in emerging markets. This catalyzes economic development while simultaneously achieving distinct social goals.

A vital component of the theory of change is our own journey to also become a “successful entrepreneur”. As an enterprise, we are committed to commercial sustainability, which forms a robust foundation for us to support our teams, ventures, and collaborators in the path to success. The same messages and skills we share with other entrepreneurs, we adopt internally to drive growth, innovation and success. We aim to support entrepreneurs to scale their businesses whilst we build Seedstars for scale!

# Ecosystems & entrepreneurs face challenges in generating social, economic and environmental impact

About Seedstars Programs

Team

Ecosystems & Entrepreneurs face multiple challenges in creating social, economic and environmental impact and contributing to the SDGs.

# Ecosystem challenges

1. Dif culties in developing sustainable and thriving Entrepreneurship Ecosystems.
2. Lack of grassroots know-how, networks, data and experience in designing and implementing high quality and result driven interventions.
3. Challenges addressing the financing needs of missing middle companies and structuring and launching the right investment vehicles to support SGBs.
4. Challenges in measuring and managing the socio-economic impact of interventions.

# Entrepreneurship challenges

1. Focus on surviving vs. generating impact
2. Entrepreneurs are de-focusing impact or not exploiting full impact potential and have limited incentive for impact at scale as their focus is to survive and build a sustainable business.

Leads to:

- Limited job creation and economic development in emerging market countries
- Unsustainable interventions with limited outcomes
- A yearly financing gap of 4.5 trillion to achieve the SDGs by 2023

# SGBs as participants: A group that contributes effectively to economic development and social impact

|About Seedstars Programs|Problem|Solution|Methodology & Differentiation|Market & Positioning|Track Record|Team|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Small and Growing businesses (SGBs) are commercially viable businesses with up to 250 employees that have significant potential and ambition for growth.| | | | | | |
|They typically seek growth capital from USD $5,000 to $2 million to support early-stage growth, expand operations, finance working capital, and acquire new assets—but they struggle to access forms of capital that meet their needs.*| | | | | | |
|SGBs have a significant and positive impact on emerging and frontier markets. They create jobs, contribute to inclusive economic growth, provide underserved populations with access to essential goods and services, and spark innovative technologies and business models.| | | | | | |
|Why we focus on supporting SGBs?| | | | | | |
|SGBs create 60% of the new quality jobs in emerging markets, increase economic growth through contributions in GDP, provide essential goods and services and drive innovation*|Commercially viable| | | | | |
|SGBs play a critical role in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) like climate action, gender equality, and reducing inequalities.| | | | | | |
|SGBs are the missing middles - too big for microfinance, too small or risky for traditional bank lending, and lack the growth, return, and exit potential sought by venture capitalists.| | | | | | |

The Seedstars Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Development (SEED)™ Methodology uses Daniel Isenberg’s six core entrepreneurship domains: Policy, Finance, Culture, Supports, Human Capital, and Markets to better classify challenges faced by entrepreneurs. For each series of interventions, research into the six domains with respect to the industry & country/region in question is completed in order to propose the interventions that would cater to specific needs and support the growth of the ecosystem.

After 10 years of supporting emerging market entrepreneurs, our main learning is that there is no “one size fits all” for capacity strengthening. Programs need to be tailored to the needs of participants according to four data-driven assessments upon which they are segmented into relevant program tracks.

# Startup ecosystems

Each of the 4 startup ecosystem categories has distinct needs and resources available, which warrants a holistic approach in order to develop the ecosystem to the next phase in the life cycle.

|About Seedstars Programs|Problem|Solution|Methodology & Differentiation|Market & Positioning|Track Record|Team|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Activation|Globalization|Attraction|Integration| | | |

Characterized by limited startup experience and output, focusing on growing the local startup community, early-stage funding, and increasing local connectedness.

Defined by more than 1K startups, increased startup experience, and significant exits, which catalyze national resource attraction and position these ecosystems as national leaders.

# Impact measurement and management

|About Seedstars|Problem|Solution|Methodology & Differentiation|Market & Positioning|Track Record|Team|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Programs| | | | | | |

At Seedstars, we use impact management and measurement to:

- Understand the full extent of our impact
- Maximize effectiveness of our programs
- Learn for continuous improvement

To meet the purpose of why we measure, we've aligned our strategy with international best practices, crafting a robust approach to effectively gauge and enhance our impact.

The Donor Committee for Enterprise Development (DCED) Standard:

- Lays the foundation, offering a structured framework for our impact assessment

The Impact Management Project:

- Enriches this foundation with detailed insights into the 'what,' 'who,' 'how much,' 'contribution,' and 'risk' of our impacts

The result is a system that is defined from the top down and aggregates data from the bottom up.

The Key Components of Our Impact Measurement System are discussed on the following slide
---
# Impact measurement and management setup and process

|About Seedstars|Problem|Solution|Methodology & Differentiation|Market & Positioning|Track Record|Team|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Programs| | | | | | |

At Seedstars, we systematically measure the impact of our programs by aligning with a structured framework. This ensures every initiative contributes to our overarching goals.

# Theory of Change (ToC)

Our impact measurement foundation lies in a well-articulated ToC for each program. This process ensures alignment with Seedstars' global mission and facilitates the identification of impactful metrics. This is our process:

- Identify Long-term Goals: Each program starts by defining its ultimate impact objectives.
- Map Out Pathways: We outline specific activities and interventions expected to lead to these goals, identifying necessary preconditions and assumptions.
- Alignment with Organizational Goals: Each ToC is aligned with Seedstars’ broader objectives, ensuring consistency across our portfolio. This includes our impact areas of Gender equality, Climate Action, and Reduced Inequalities.

# Measurement Metrics

Using the program-specific Theory of Change, we identify indicators - both unique to the program and our overarching core metrics.

- Core Metrics: These universal metrics allow us to aggregate impact across programs, facilitating comparison and benchmarking.
- Program-Specific Metrics: Tailored to each program’s unique objectives, these metrics provide deep insights and fulfill partner reporting requirements.

# Data Collection Strategy:

We rely on collecting data from our startups through surveys at four points:

1. Baseline Assessments: Initial deep dives via needs and investment readiness assessments set the baseline, framing our understanding of the starting point for each startup.
2. During Program Feedback: Continuous feedback mechanisms for real-time adjustments.
3. End-of-Program Evaluation: A crucial check-in against our key metrics to assess immediate outcomes and impacts.
4. Annual Alumni Surveys: Track long-term program impact, validating the ToC over time.

What should the "ideal" startup acceleration program look like?

The "ideal" startup acceleration program

Is Wo8

The idea accelerator should consist of 3 key phases that involve; (1) A set of activities at the beginning of the program, (2) A set of activities during the program and (3) a set of activities after the program:

- Workout
- Fundraising opportunities
- Human Capital

Activities within each phase needs to be set up deliberately and not on an ad-hoc/passive basis:

- Knowledge (skills and abilities)
- Marketing
- Engagement
- Piloting opportunities
- Entrepreneurial Motivation
- Success
- Income & Security
- Recognition

Every program should reflect the needs of both the participants and the accelerator for there to be an optimal impact. There may be different combinations to ensure all acceleration programs should look alike as needs are met.

# Story in this section

In this section the goal is to go deeper into what we do to solve the challenges of each type of enterprise at each stage, sector, ecosystem and financing need.

Indeed we could do it by type of program Incubator, Accelerator, Growth and showcase for each of them what we do? Does this make sense?

The alternative is we showcase how we differentiate programs based on the different elements, type, stage, sector, ecosystem, financing need.
